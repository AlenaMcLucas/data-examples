\begin_layout Title
Texting During Class and GPA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Alena McLucas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
September 30th, 2015
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This is my first time merging RStudio and LyX together to test my ability
 to perform basic econometric functions in R and format the results and
 proceeding analysis at a competitve level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
I will be using this for the remainder of my Econ 104 work and perhaps more
 for converting my TIM work into something more comprehensive.
 Note I like using sections and subsections.
 One issue I see is that paragraphs are bold...
 Also the separator doesen't do anything.
 Labeling is for one word terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set contains 3 variables and 61 observations.
 The first binary variable 
\emph on
Male
\emph default
 is 1 if the subject is male or 0 indicating female.
 
\emph on
Texts_class
\emph default
 is the number of times a person sends a text during a given class.
 Lastly, 
\emph on
GPA 
\emph default
is the student's grade point average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Read Data into R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To perform regressions in R, one must first read in data from a given file.
 File 
\emph on
testing_survey.csv
\emph default
 is read in based on the file path on my local hard drive.
 The .csv file is saved as 
\emph on
texting
\emph default
.
 The code also tells R the headers are saved in the csv file and will be
 kept as variables for later use.
 It also explains that the .csv file uses commas to separate values so it
 knows where each data point begins and ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attach the data so when we refer to columns, rows and data we can do so
 by invoking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

texting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as opposed to its full path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are now ready to explore the data set through graphs to familiarize with
 trends and prepare for running regressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Display Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To check distributions and practice with histograms, we are plotting different
 data points and inferring what we can from each one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This histogram plots the 
\emph on
Male
\emph default
 frequency distribution and gives it its title.
 It confirms 
\emph on
Male
\emph default
 is binary, with all values either being 0 or 1.
 We learn this data set has about 20 females and 40 males, a 1:2 ratio.
 See the Appendix, Figure 3.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying similar code, we examine the 
\emph on
Texts_class
\emph default
 distribution graph.
 Make sure the x-axis breaks at 50 so the histogram focuses on where we
 have the highest frequency of texts per class.
 Most subjects send up to 10 texts per class, but there are definitely a
 significant number of students who send more.
 See the Appendix, Figure 3.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, we create the 
\emph on
GPA
\emph default
 distribution graph and break it at 50.
 Most studends have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, but there are a significant number
 with lower GPAs.
 This is a similar trend as with 
\emph on
Texts_class
\emph default
.
 See the Appendix, Figure 3.3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, plot 
\emph on
GPA
\emph default
 against 
\emph on
Texts_class
\emph default
 to better understand their relationship.
 There is clearly a decrease in GPA when texts per class increases, or a
 seemingly negative correlation.
 To test this, run a regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Run Basic Regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regress 
\emph on
Texts_class
\emph default
 onto 
\emph on
GPA
\emph default
.
 Looking at the regression's summary statistics.
 [Go over estimates/equation, std.
 error, t-value, Pr(>|t|), p-value, etc.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a negative correlation between sent texts per class and GPA.
 This makes sense, as being distracted during class would likely cause your
 grades to decrease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This exercise was a great introduction into using LyX, performing basic
 econometric functions in R Studio, and setting a standard format for my
 portfolio of projects.
 From here, I can strongly move forward with homework assignments and papers.
