 and Deaths

\begin_layout Abstract
The Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) has been a debated subject for decades,
 as the United States drinking age is three years higher than in many other
 countries.
 This paper explores the impact of the United States’ MLDA on drinking and
 mortality using data from the NHIS and NVSS.
 After identifying the best-fit regression from tests of different polynomial
 orders, we calculate the instrumental variable effect.
 The results of calculating this effect tell us that lowering the MLDA would
 increase mortality by about 47 deaths per 100,000 people.
 Assumptions to validate the use of regression discontinuity and MLDA as
 the instrument variable are mostly met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much does the MLDA reduce the proportion of the population that drinks?
 How much does the MLDA reduce mortality? Do the IV assumptions validate
 or invalidate the use of the IV estimate? The important points covered
 by this paper all accumulate to calculating the amounts that the MLDA reduces
 the population that drinks and reduces mortality.
 This is pertinent because the question is frequently posed as to if we
 should lower or keep the MLDA.
 We use several methods on the data to ensure accuracy so that a definitive
 assertion can be made.
 We use 21 years of age as an instrument to determine how the MLDA affects
 mortality.
 In order to calculate the instrumental variable estimate, assumptions are
 made that must be examined.
 These results are important because they support the notion that the MLDA
 should not be lowered to 18.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The government regularly collects data to monitor the health of the United
 States, and the NHIS is one of the most reputable polls of information.
 Calculations derived from these surveys are used to make statistics that
 are nationally applicable.
 There has been no information given about how the mortality data was collected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method we used to interpret the jump in data at 21 years of age is regressio
n discontinuity, which is comprised of two main components: regression tables
 and figures.
 Drinking alcohol, all deaths, motor vehicle accidents, and alcohol-related
 deaths data were used in linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions.
 We ran second regressions with a birthday variable on each of these regressions
 to trace the MLDA’s affects.
 The figures were made by trial-and-error methods, plugging in different
 values for bin size, x-axis and y-axis.
 We find that the MLDA reduces drinking by about 9.55%, and the birthday
 effect is not significant.
 The change in all deaths, motor vehicle accidents, and alcohol poisoning
 are 9.55, 4.35, and 0.44, respectively.
 The birthday affect is significant for alcohol poisoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The IV estimate was calculated based on the best regressions from drinking
 alcohol and all deaths, both quadratic.
 It is about 47.35 with a standard error of 10.08.
 After obtaining the IV estimate, we test and find that almost all of the
 assumptions have been met.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data about who drinks, how much, and general demographic information
 was collected by the National Health Interview Sample Adults Files between
 1997 and 2007.
 The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an organization that is
 executed through the U.S.
 Census Bureau to assess the welfare of people in a variety of topics relating
 to the “amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in
 the United States” (“About the…”).
 The NHIS resurveys people every 10-15 years, hence the information is most
 relevant to the aforementioned 10 year gap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mortality data came from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).
 This data is shared directly out of the Centers for Disease Control and
 Prevention.
 It collects its data through its contract with vital registration systems
 that record significant events like “births, deaths, marriages, divorces,
 and fetal deaths” (“National Vital…”).
 An additional note we recall from class is that this data assumes everyone’s
 birthday is on the 15th of the month they were born in.
 This biases the data downward, but only slightly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design makes comparisons by leveraging changes
 in treatment exposure probability.
 It allows the slope of a line to change at the threshold, where treatment
 probability changes, of the forcing variable age.
 MLDA is a prime example, as the government tells people that they can or
 cannot drink based on age and will choose their treatment status.
 The jump before and after 21 for percentage of people that drink and number
 of people that die is immediately noticeable when one looks at the plotted
 data, which is ideal for regression discontinuity.
 The two components to this approach are: (1) Figures, and (2) Regressions.
 We will also calculate the Instrumental Variable estimate to find the true
 treatment effect, and examine the assumptions under which it is a valid
 measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures are important because they help the data tell a story by focusing
 on the pertinent portions and excluding irrelevant ones.
 In order to find the right bin size, x-axis range and y-axis range we use
 trial-and error as well as past experience to select the best values.
 We must first pick an appropriate bin size, which is the number of days
 that will be averaged to create one data point in the graph.
 We choose 32 as it strikes the balance between too noisy (from higher bin
 sizes) and too smooth (from lower bin sizes).
 The x-axis should focus on 21 years of age, or the threshold, so the range
 selected goes from 19 to 23.
 This gives us just enough room to see the trend, but not so much room that
 we see the sharp incline from 18 to 19 or the steady, slight decline that
 persists after turning 21 until 30 years of age.
 Lastly, the y-axis is automatically selected by R to fit the data best.
 It is coded anyways for clarity’s sake, making them 0.45 to 0.75 for the
 NHIS data, 85 to 110 for all deaths, 25 to 40 for motor vehicle accidents,
 and 0.0 to 3.0 for alcohol poisoning.
 A line from each regression found below was constructed for a visual comparison
 of each polynomial order to find the line of best fit for the data, meaning
 on average it summarizes the data the best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run the regressions, we are taking a parametric approach by experimenting
 with different polynomial orders and running them on a fixed range of 19
 to 23 years of age.
 The higher polynomial orders in x give more flexibility in fitting the
 data, are less likely to be biased, but have higher variance estimates.
 As the data has significant slopes, we will not be running zero-order polynomia
ls; instead, we will run linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions.
 The regressions are run a second time adjusting for covariates, in this
 case the birthday effect.
 By including this variable in the regression, we check that the model fits
 the data well and that there are no significant changes unexplained by
 the regression.
 In this case, the most likely effect that intersects with the MLDA is that
 it is a person’s birthday, and they are likely to celebrate that regardless
 of the MLDA.
 To assess the birthday effect’s beta, one must find its t-statistic to
 see if it is statistically significant.
 If it is, it must be contextualized in the application to see if it is
 economically significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make the table, we construct a column in the data that contains a 1 if
 the person drinks and a 0 if they do not, so a subset had to be created
 to make sure those were the only values.
 This column contains binary results, so in order to average the number
 of people who identify with each at each age, the data had to be aggregated.
 The data from the NHIS spans from age 18 to 30, and so a subset of the
 original data was made that contained all data points between 19 and 23.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prepare the data for the regressions, we created a dummy variable so
 that two lines could be derived from the same regression to represent under
 21 and over 21 people.
 This variable is 0 if the individual is under 21, and 1 if the individual
 is 21 or over.
 This fosters a break at 21 years of age so a second line can be plotted
 with different characteristics.
 We then constructed new columns to represent the variables that would have
 to be multiplied together, including the interaction terms, so they wouldn’t
 cause errors in calculation.
 Lastly, a variable for the birthday effect was created that requires a
 person to be exactly 21 to be equal to 1 and 0 otherwise.
 This is testing to see if the birthday effect is unique to the 21st birthday
 because it is at the MLDA, or if it any jump is due to unaccounted for
 factors like general celebration of a birthday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equations for the linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions are as follows,
 with ‘drinks alcohol’ being replaced by ‘all deaths’, ‘motor vehicle accidents’
, and ‘alcohol poisoning’ for the mortality regressions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear: drinks alcohol = β0 + β1from21 + β2over21 + β3from21*over21 + u
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadratic: drinks alcohol = β0 + β1from21 + β2over21 + β3from21*over21 +
 β4from21*from21 + β5from21*from21*over21 + u
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cubic: drinks alcohol = β¬¬0 + β1from21 + β2over21 + β3from21*over21 + β4from21*
from21 + β5from21*from21*over21 + β¬6age*from21*from21 + β7from21*from21*from21*
over21 + u.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For comparison’s sake, we made a regression table that contains linear,
 quadratic, and cubic regression covariates with and without the birthday
 affect.
 The t-statistics for the age covariates must be calculated to determine
 the line of best fit from regression’s standpoint, and the t-statistic
 for the birthday covariate must be calculated to determine if the celebration
 of a birthday affects the regressions ability to capture the data’s trends
 well.
 These tables allow us to numerically look at t-statistics to determine
 the best one, as anything at or above 2.00 is generally acceptable.
 The results must be compared both in the table and visually in the figure
 that contains the three plotted regressions to select the best-fitting
 polynomial order.
 The jump, or birthday effect at the MLDA, can then be calculated by subtracting
 the under 21 line from the over 21 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Instrumental Variable Estimate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The instrumental variable (IV) estimate is helpful to answer the questions
 posed in this report because it is the true treatment affect of treatment
 exposure on outcome.
 To calculate it, the best regressions for drinking alcohol and all deaths
 onto age must be picked, and their coefficients and standard errors noted.
 The First Stage (D = B0 + B1Z + u) must be calculated, which is the effect
 of assignment to treatment on the treatment status.
 Then, we calculate the Reduced Form (Y = P0 + P1Z + u), or the effect of
 treatment assignment on the outcome.
 The coefficients from the treatment assignment variable from both derivations
 are then taken, and the one from the Reduced Form (P1) is divided by the
 one from the First Stage (B1).
 This yields the IV estimate, the true treatment effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the following assumptions must be defined and subsequently assessed
 in the context of this study to see if it has been violated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 1 (SUTVA): outcomes for each individual are not affect by treatment
 status of other individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 2 (Ignorable Assignment): assignment of treatment status is random.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 3 (Exclusion Restriction): there is a single causal change from
 treatment assignment to treatment exposure to the outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 4 (Nonzero Average Causal Effect of Z on D): if one averages
 the effect of treatment exposure on treatment status, it does not equal
 zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 5 (Monotonicity Assumption): we can assume that there would be
 a change for each individual with and without the treatment, though we
 can only observe one treatment status (Angrist 446-447).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumptions are evaluated in the Conclusion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
NHIS Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 1 contains the graphs with each regression.
 Visually, it would appear that the linear regression does captures the
 trends fairly well, but the quadratic regression summarizes the data a
 bit better with its notable curve for the over 21 line.
 The regression table with estimates of changes in drinking are in Figure
 1.
 It has the linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions with and without the
 birthday effect.
 Looking at these results, it would appear that quadratic regression forms
 the lines of best fit as overall it has the highest t-statistics, meaning
 they are less likely to have happened due to chance.
 We therefore prefer the quadratic regression.
 Figure 2 is the final figure with the quadratic regression of drinking
 alcohol onto age.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MLDA reduces drinking, and to calculate that reduction we must subtract
 the line representing over 21 in our quadratic regression from the line
 representing under 21 in the same regression.
 If one subtracts the under 21 regression line from the over 21 regression
 line with any polynomial order, they will get the value β2.
 This determines if the MLDA reduces drinking and by how much.
 For the NHIS data, we get 9.55.
 Therefore, the MLDA reduces drinking by about 9.55%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The t-statistics for the birthday effects are 0.67, 1.33 and 1.20.
 This means the birthday effect is not significant on the 21st birthday
 for the percentage of the population that drinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mortality Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph with estimates of change in all deaths, motor vehicle accidents,
 and alcohol poisoning are depicted in Figures 3, 5, and 7, respectively,
 and the regression tables are depicted in Tables 2, 3, and 4.
 We prefer the quadratic regression for all deaths because, though the linear
 t-statistic is higher, the quadratic regression graph clearly has a defined
 curvature.
 We prefer the linear regression for motor vehicle accidents because it
 has the highest t-statistic and the linear line summarizes the trends of
 the data well.
 Lastly, alcohol poisoning could really be linear or quadratic, but because
 the t-statistic is about 2.0 higher for the linear regression we prefer
 it.
 Figure 4,6, and 8 contain the final figures with the scatterplots and preferred
 regressions overlaid.
 Figure 9 contains a graph for motor vehicle accidents, alcohol poisoning
 and age to put the difference in deaths into perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the same logic in the previous section, we can calculate the reduction
 in mortality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All deaths (quadratic regression) = 9.55
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motor vehicle accidents (linear regression) = 4.35
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alcohol poisoning (linear regression) = 0.44
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the change in all deaths, motor vehicle accidents, and alcohol
 poisoning are a 9.55, 4.35, and 0.44 decrease, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The t-statistics for the birthday effects are below 2.00 for all deaths and
 motor vehicle accidents, meaning the birthday effect is not significant.
 However, the t-statistics for alcohol poisoning are 4.17, 4.15, and 2.9.
 This means that the birthday effect is significant, which makes sense because
 it is the first day a person can legally drink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IV Estimate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important part of this paper is proved by the IV estimate because it
 will tell us the additional deaths per 100,000 people at the MLDA for all
 deaths.
 As we have chosen quadratic regressions for both the NHIS data and all
 deaths, those are the regressions that must be plugged into the equations
 and code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plugging in the quadratic equations, 47.35 is the IV estimate with a standard
 error of 10.08.
 Dividing them, we get 47.35 / 10.08 = 4.70.
 A t-statistic this high means that it is unlikely these results occurred
 by chance and are fairly accurate.
 This means that, for every 100,000 people, about 47 less people will die
 on their 21st birthday.
 However, we must take caution because this IV estimate was calculated with
 all deaths.
 This would include deaths that occurred for other reasons but were included
 in the data set (i.e.
 Homicide, Suicide, Drugs, Other External Causes, etc).
 47 less deaths are about the true treatment effect of the MLDA on mortality
 per 100,000 people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to check if our IV method was justified, we must test the assumptions
 to see if they hold.
 The SUTVA assumption was violated in this study, as people who are drunk
 can cause the mortality of those that are not drunk.
 The ignorable assignment assumption is not violated because assignment
 is base purely on age.
 The exclusion restriction assumption is not violated because actions taken
 that affect mortality cannot be changed, and the assignment has a direct
 effect on treatment exposure which has a direct effect on outcome.
 The nonzero average causal effect of assignment on action is not violated
 because there is a causal effect of assignment on exposure.
 Lastly, the monotonicity assumption is violated because people who are
 below 21 do drink, and people above 21 do not drink by choice or for health
 reasons.
 This means that our overall results should only be taken into consideration
 under these pretenses and contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much does the MLDA reduce the proportion of the population that drinks?
 We find that the MLDA reduces drinking by about 9.55%, and the birthday
 effect is not significant.
 How much does the MLDA reduce mortality? The decrease in all deaths, motor
 vehicle accidents, and alcohol poisoning are 9.55, 4.35, and 0.44, respectively.
 The birthday affect is significant for alcohol poisoning.
 What is the IV estimate, and do the IV assumptions validate or invalidate
 the use of the IV estimate? The IV estimate is about 47, meaning that for
 every 100,000 people, about 47 less people will die on their 21st birthday
 with the MLDA at 21.
 After obtaining the IV estimate, we test and find that almost all of the
 assumptions have been met.
 From these results, we can conclude that the drinking age should not be
 lowered from 21 in the United States.
